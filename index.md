## Symposium on Benchmarking Robotic Object Manipulation

19-20 September 2022<br/>
Kalyves, Crete, Greece

### About the Symposium

Grasping rigid objects has been reasonably studied under a wide variety of settings.
The common measure of success is whether the robot is able to pick and hold an object for a few seconds.
This setting is not realistic - depending on what we actually want to do with the object, we have to grasp in different ways.
We therefore need to focus on complete tasks of manipulating objects.
However, so far robotics suffers from impaired comparability of works on robotic object manipulation due to the lack of established benchmarks and tools for reproducible experiments.

The goals of this Symposium therefore include presenting current works on benchmarking object manipulation as well as recent developments of tools for reproducible research; discussing which robotic manipulation tasks can be formalised and are suitable for benchmarking; identifiying further needs to push the community towards an uptake of existing benchmarks.
